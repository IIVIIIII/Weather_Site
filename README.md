This repo involves data from an earlier exercise of mine in which the temperature(F), humidity(%), wind speed(mph), and cloudiness(%) of over 500 randomly selected cities across the globe is plotted against each respective city's latitude. This data is then presented though a series of html pages which provide overview and analysis of the project.
